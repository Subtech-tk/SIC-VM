## Guidelines

Codes should:

* have a clear function, that's easy to explain and understand
* minimizing any complex logic that's extraneous
* demonstrate good-practice use of the technology, even at the expense of extra complexity

If you're not sure about anything, just ask.

## Introduction into Git and GitHub

If you are new to Git, GitHub and the whole open source software community, welcome! Here are some resources for getting started and understanding what it's all about.

- [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) by Code School
- [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com)

If you're not particularly fond of the command line, you can get one of GitHub's free GUI desktop apps:

- [GitHub for Mac](https://github.com/blog/1510-installing-git-from-github-for-mac)
- [GitHub for Windows](https://github.com/blog/1127-github-for-windows)

If you're feeling adventurous, you can become a Git & GitHub master with the [Git Path on Code School](https://www.codeschool.com/paths/git).
