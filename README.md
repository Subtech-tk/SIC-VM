# SIC-VM
  A interpreter shell designed to run SIC program

### SIC concept
  The Simplified Instructional Computer (also abbreviated SIC) is a hypothetical computer system introduced in *System Software: An Introduction to Systems Programming, by Leland Beck.* Due to the fact that most modern microprocessors include subtle, complex functions for the purposes of efficiency, it can be difficult to learn systems programming using a real-world system. The Simplified Instructional Computer solves this by abstracting away these complex behaviors in favor of an architecture that is clear and accessible for those wanting to learn systems programming.
